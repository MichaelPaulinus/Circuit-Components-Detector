# Circuit-Components-Detector
A model that is able to detect electrical components in an electrical circuit

This model was trained for 2 hours, using 200 random circuits generated by the source code in this link:

To run this model:
1. Run the powershell script from this link:

2. Unextract the Object_detection.zip to your C: drive

3. Open the command prompt and enter:
  cd C:\Object_detection\models-master\research
  conda create -n tf2
  activate tf2
  jupyter notebook
  
4. Your web browser should now be opened and a jupyter labs tab should be open, open the file "object_detection_tutorial.ipynb" in jupyter notebook
   
5. Run all the segments of code, at the end you will see the images and their detection percentage at the end

6. If you would like to run detection through video, simply replace the "object_detection_tutorial.ipynb" file in the "research" directory with the "object_detection_tutorial.ipynb" in the "######ipynb video" directory and follow step 5
